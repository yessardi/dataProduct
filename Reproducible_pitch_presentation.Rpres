Background:
========================================================

* NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
contains over **1.8 millions**
 + omics samples
generated by **distinct** microarray platforms, 
 + from **different** manufacturers, 
 + each with **its own** measurement protocol, 
 + thus, omics data **can hardly** be compared 

* Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
 + assess the **quality** and **appropriateness** of each GEO sample 
 + determine an **optimal** threshold value for each sample


Input:
========================================================

1. select one or multiple GEO accession IDs from the list: GSE19587, GSE20141, GSE20291, GSE20292, GSE20295, GSE20333, GSE24378, GSE53987, GSE54282, GSE7621, GSE8397")


2. provide a list of context-related manual curation (a default list is already provided)
  + ~150 active genes
  + ~40 inactive genes
  
  


Interpretation of the ROC curves:
========================================================


1. Curves **above** the baseline (the diagonal reference) indicates that, the samples (GSMs) can have a **higher** chance of predicting the true positive and false positive genes.

2. Curves that fall **along or below** the baseline indicates that, their predicting abilities could be worse than the random, and thus the samples (GSMs) have a relatively **lower** chance of predicting the genes.



Results:

========================================================

After comparing 12 retrieved GEO datasets using two different heterogeneous and homogeneous processing methods (not described here, not included in the web app), we found that: 

**Samples (GSM#â€™s) from the same study (GSE#) can have very different ROC curves**. For example, please see below the curves for all the samples GSMs of the dataset GSE20333. All the samples have different shapes of curves.

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,out.height = 250,out.width=350 }
load('/Users/longfeimao/Documents/Longfei/Documents/experimental/modeling tools/cobra/various defined tools/Projects/IO development/writeXLS/omics/R/developingFunctions/testingParameters/results/web/forWeb1.RData')
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
f<-g_processed
f$data<-filter(f$data, str_detect(group,'GSE20333'))
print(f)
```
