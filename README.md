# Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This repository contains the files required for the Data Products course project. The goal of the project was:

1. To create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers, and
2. To prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about this application.

Because the main focus of the project is to develop an interacting application rather than implementation of proper algorithms, the code of the R functions for auotomatically retrieving and processing (e.g., normalising) transcriptomics data from [NCBI GEO database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) is **not** provided here


1. The Shiny application can be found under: [https://longfei.shinyapps.io/test/](hhttps://longfei.shinyapps.io/test/).


2. The reproducible pitch presentation about this application is available under: [http://rpubs.com/gogo198888/200199](http://rpubs.com/gogo198888/200199).


3. The code used for creating the Shiny application and preparing the pitch presentation can be found under: [https://github.com/gogo1988/dataProduct](https://github.com/gogo1988/dataProduct).
