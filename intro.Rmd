### This is a Shiny application for testing the quality of the NCBI GEO transcriptomics data

The 12 transcriptomics datasets (studies) with 1260 GSMs (samples) are downloaded from [NCBI GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), and their accession IDs are listed below:

GSE19587, GSE20141, GSE20291, GSE20292, GSE20295, GSE20333, GSE24378, GSE53987, GSE54282, GSE7621, GSE8397.



The code of this Shiny application and reproducible pitch presentation can be found at [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/gogo1988/dataProduct)

## Background:

* [NCBI GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
contains over **1.8 millions**
 + omics samples
generated by **distinct** microarray platforms, 
 + from **different** manufacturers, 
 + each with **its own** measurement protocol, 
 + thus, omics data **can hardly** be compared 

* Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
 + assess the **quality** and **appropriateness** of each GEO sample 
 + determine an **optimal** threshold value for each sample

## Input:

1. select one or multiple GEO accession IDs from the list: GSE19587, GSE20141, GSE20291, GSE20292, GSE20295, GSE20333, GSE24378, GSE53987, GSE54282, GSE7621, GSE8397"). The twelve transcriptomics datasets are downloaded from NCBI geo database


2. provide a list of context-related manual curation (a default list is already provided)
  + ~150 active genes
  + ~40 inactive genes

## Interpretation of the ROC curves:


1. Curves **above** the baseline (the diagonal reference) indicates that, the samples (GSMs) can have a **higher** chance of predicting the true positive and false positive genes.

2. Curves that fall **along or below** the baseline indicates that, their predicting abilities could be worse than the random, and thus the samples (GSMs) have a relatively **lower** chance of predicting the genes.

## Results:

After comparing 12 retrieved GEO datasets using two different heterogeneous and homogeneous processing methods (NOTE: the methods are neither described here nor included in github repository of the the web app, since the description of the methods deviates from the scope of this project which was to develop a interacting Shiny application), we found that: 

*Samples (GSM#â€™s) from the same study (GSE#) can have very different ROC curves*
